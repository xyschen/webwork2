# Configuration for using LTI authentication.
# To enable this file, uncomment the appropriate lines in localOverrides.conf
# The settings in this file apply to both LTI 1.1 and LTI 1.3 authentication.
# The settings specific to the LTI 1.1 authenticatio are in authen_LTI_1_1.conf.
# The settings specific to the LTI 1.3 authenticatio are in authen_LTI_1_3.conf.

# Set debug_lti_parameters to 1 to have LTI calling parameters printed to HTML page for
# debugging.  This is useful when setting things up for the first time because different LMS
# systems have different parameters
$debug_lti_parameters = 0;

# To get more information on passing grades back to the LMS enmass set debug_lti_grade_passback
# to one.  And set the LTIMassUpdateInterval to 60 (seconds).
$debug_lti_grade_passback = 0;

# This will print into the webwork2 app log the success or failure of updating each user/set.

# Setting both debug_lti_parameters and debug_lti_grade_passback will cause the full request and
# response between the LMS and WW to be printed into webwork2 app log file for each user/set
# update of the grade.

# The switches above can be set in course.conf to enable debugging for just one course.

# If you want even more information enable the debug facility in the webwork2.mojolicious.yml
# file.  This will print extensive debugging messages for all courses.

# Note that for LTI 1.3 not all debug message will make it back to the HTML page due to the
# nature of how LTI 1.3 authentication works with automatic form submissions and redirects.

# This section enables LTI authentication.  If a course uses LTI 1.1 (see $LTIVersion below),
# then the LTIAdvanced module will be used.  If a course uses LTI 1.3 (see $LTIVersion below),
# the LTIAdvantage will be used.  If you know a site will not use one or the other, it can be
# commented out. Failover to Basic_TheLastOption is necessary to authenticate with cookie keys.

];

# Include configurations.  You must uncomment at least one of the following. You may uncomment
# both if the site may be using both LTI 1.1 and 1.3 in different courses. After uncommenting
# the LTI_1_x line, you must copy the file authen_LTI_1_x.conf.dist to authen_LTI_1_x.conf and
# then edit that file to fill in the settings for LTI_1_x.
#include('conf/authen_LTI_1_1.conf');
#include('conf/authen_LTI_1_3.conf');

# This is the default LTI version that will be used for the site.  This must be 'v1p1' for LTI
# 1.1 authentication, 'v1p3' for LTI 1.3 authentication, or '' to disable LTI authentication.
# A course may override this setting to use the other version of LTI authentication or to
# disable LTI authentication for the course.
$LTIVersion = 'v1p1';

# WeBWorK will automatically create users when logging in via the LMS for the first time as long
# as the permission level is less than or equal to the permission level of this setting.  For

# Set this variable to 'professor' if you want professor accounts to be created automatically.
$LTIAccountCreationCutoff = 'ta';

# If the following flag is enabled then the user demographic data will be kept up to date with

# next time the student logs in.

# If the preferred module is an external authentication module but the sequence includes an
# internal authentication system, e.g., Basic_TheLastOption, then $external_auth (below) must be
# set to 1 (or true). If the value is 1, then, if the authentication sequence reaches
# Basic_TheLastOption, then WeBWorK::Login will display a screen directing the user back to an
# external authentication system.  This prevents you from attempting to login in to WeBWorK
# directly.

# Authorization system LTI:  LMS Grade Passback
################################################################################################

# WeBWorK can automatically report grades back to your LMS.  However the system is reasonably
# restrictive.  When you create an LTI link in your LMS you can choose to have that LTI link
# have a grade associated to it.  WeBWorK can report back a single percentage as the "grade" for
# that link.  There are two modes under which this can occur.

# Single Course Grade Mode:  $LTIGradeMode = 'course';
# In this mode you create a single Link/Assignment which points to your WeBWorK Course address.
# Students will receive a LMS grade associated to the Link/Assignment which is determined by
# their percentage total homework grade in WeBWorK.  This total homework grade is the same as
# the grade that is reported on the grades page.  You can change the weight of sets by altering
# the weight of the problems in the set.

# Individual Homework Grade Mode:  $LTIGradeMode = 'homework';
# In this mode you create a single Link/Assignment for *every* homework set in the course.  The
# address should be the address of that set in the Course.  Students will receive a grade for
# each Link/Assignment which is determined by their percentage homework grade on the Set which
# the Link/Assignment points to.  Students need to use the Link/Assignment in the LMS at least
# once to enable grade passback.  In particular when working in this mode it is recommended that
# you only allow students to log in via the LMS.

# Note: For both of these modes only the grades are passed back.  In particular nothing else
# about the Link/Assignment in the LMS and the homework set in WeBWorK is synchronized.  In
# particular the total number of points/problems, the due dates, the open dates are not kept in
# sync automatically (yet).

# Site Administrator Note for LTI 1.3:  This uses OAuth2 RSA private/public keys.  These keys
# are automatically generated the first time that they are needed.  It is recommended that new
# keys are generated on a regular basis.  At this point, key rotation is not automatic for
# webwork2.  Howevever, it is simple.  Delete the files $webwork2_dir/DATA/lti_private_key.json
# and $webwork2_dir/DATA/lti_public_key.json.  New keys will then be automatically generated the
# next time they are needed.  Probably a good rule of thumb (for now) is to do this at the
# beginning of every term.

$LTIGradeMode = '';
#$LTIGradeMode = 'course';
#$LTIGradeMode = 'homework';

# When set this variable sends grades back to the LMS every time a user submits an answer.  This
# keeps students grades up to date but can be a drain on the server.
$LTIGradeOnSubmit = 1;

# If CheckPrior is set to 1 then the current LMS grade will be checked first, and if the grade
# has not changed then the grade will not be updated.  This is intended to reduce changes to LMS
# records when no real grade change occurred.  It requires a 2 round process, first querying the
# current grade from the LMS and then when needed making the grade submission.
$LTICheckPrior = 0;

# The system periodically updates student grades on the LMS.  This variable controls how often
# that happens.  Set to -1 to disable.
