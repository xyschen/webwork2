This problem demonstrates how WeBWorK handles 
numerical answers involving units.  WeBWorK can handle all units that
are used in elementary physics courses.
See \{ htmlLink("http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Units","answers with units") \}  
for more details. $PAR

Two perpendicular sides of a triangle are $fx m and
$fy m long respectively.  
What is the length of the third side of the triangle? $BR$BR
You can answer this in terms of m's, cm's, km's, in's, ft, etc. but you must enter the units. $BR$BR
Click "Hint" below if you don't remember the Pythagorean theorem.

HINT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
Remembering the Pythagorean theorem \( A^2 +B^2 = C^2 \), you can enter
sqrt(${fx}${CARET}2 + ${fy}${CARET}2) m or  \{spf($ansxy, "%0.2f" )\} m or  \{spf($anscm, "%0.2f" )\} cm or ...
