		. 'and sets can be acted on at the same time, it is often more efficient to use this page when modifying '
		. 'multiple items.  For example, after selecting several users and a set you can change the close date for '
		. 'all selected users for that set.  This page also gives access to "View/Edit all sets for one user", '
		. 'which can be used to access settings for all sets including test versions for that user.') =%>

		. 'selected using ctrl-click or shift-click.  The action buttons are grouped into three categories.  The '
		. 'first is a set of actions that act on the selected users, the second is a set of actions that act on the '
		. 'selected sets, and the third is a set of actions for acting on a combination of sets and users.  If an '
